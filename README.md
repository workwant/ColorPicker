# ColorPicker
on-screen color pickup tool designed for designers and developers to increase productivity
## Why do I need to develop this app ?
I've been using the color picker that comes with the system, it's small and fast, but there are obvious drawbacks, it can't display hexadecimal, and it's not easy to copy and convert to other color formats. Also I would like to know where the colors are on the color wheel, after all it is easier to remember the approximate position of the colors than the numbers, which is very important for me as I am just learning design
